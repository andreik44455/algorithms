1) after running program in the gdb, I got segemenation fault error.

2) allocated memory for work.second in the process procedure. Now have 
null in the output instead of value of work.second.

3) changed memory allocation for work.second to main. 

4) error when trying to compile: ‘for’ loop initial declarations are only
allowed in C99 mode. Need to declare i before for loop.

5) logic error in the first for loop. i<=strlen(work.first)+1 (do not need + 1). Found with valgrind.

6) Had errors with memory allocation after running valgrind. 
It was because wrong memory allocation. Need to allocate appropriate memory for work.second and temp.

7) Issue: outputs "hello world" for work.first, because temp was pointing to the same memory as work.first.
Need to give it another memory and just copy value of work.first
